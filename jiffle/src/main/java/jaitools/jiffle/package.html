    The Jiffle scripting language allows you to create images from expressions
    consisting of mathematical and logical operators, pre-defined and user-defined
    constants, and data from input images. Using Jiffle you can do many of the
    things that you otherwise might write a JAI ImageFunction to accomplish, but
    with much less code.
    <p>
    For an overview of the language see:

    <p>
    Jiffle is based on the r.mapcalc language which was developed for raster algebra
    in GRASS GIS. Information about GRASS and r.mapcalc is available at
    <a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/">grass.osgeo.org</a>.
