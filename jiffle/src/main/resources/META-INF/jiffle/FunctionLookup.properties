# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE unless you are modifying the Jiffle compiler itself.

# Keys are either the name as used in Jiffle or name + numArgs for

# Values are Jiffle name, runtime source name, number of args (-1 for var arg),
# function provider (JIFFLE, MATH or PROXY), and whether the
# function is volatile (true or false).
