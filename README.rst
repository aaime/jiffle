Jiffle
======

Jiffle is a scripting language for creating and analysing raster images. Rather than having to write 
and test lots of JAI or Java AWT boiler-plate code to access and manipulate images, Jiffle lets you 
concentrate on the interesting bit: your algorithm.

Jiffle is being developed as part of the `JAITools project <http://jaitools.org>`_.
