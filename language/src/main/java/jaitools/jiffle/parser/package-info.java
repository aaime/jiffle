/**
 * Jiffle parser and support classes. In addition to the hand-written classes
 * in this package, further parser classes are generated from the ANTLR grammars
 * which define the language syntax and the steps in Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
 * construction.
 * <p>
 * The Jiffle compiler works by first creating an AST from the input Jiffle
 * script. Next, a number of tree parsers check the AST for semantic errors.
 * This is followed by tree rewriting, in which the AST is re-structured to
 * make it more suitable for the final step: runtime class source code generation.
 * The resulting source code can be retrieved by the client and/or compiled into
 * executable bytecode by Jiffle's embedded Janino compiler.
